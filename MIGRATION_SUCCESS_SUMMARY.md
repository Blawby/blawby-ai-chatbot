## 📋 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Better Auth Table Compatibility**
- **Problem:** Better Auth expected singular table names, production had plural
- **Solution:** Renamed all Better Auth tables to singular format
- **Result:** Better Auth now works correctly with production database

### **2. Missing Stripe Field**
- **Problem:** `stripe_customer_id` field missing from subscription table
- **Solution:** Added the field to support Better Auth Stripe plugin
- **Result:** Stripe plugin can now create and manage subscriptions

### **3. Duplicate Tables**
- **Problem:** Both `subscription` and `subscriptions` tables existed
- **Solution:** Merged data and removed duplicate table
- **Result:** Clean, consistent schema

### **4. Schema Consistency**
- **Problem:** Local and production schemas were incompatible
- **Solution:** Aligned production schema with local development
- **Result:** Consistent behavior across environments
