## üß† Team Configuration (`teams.json`)

Manage law firm team configs via JSON:

```json
{
  "id": "demo",
  "name": "Blawby Demo",
  "config": {
    "consultationFee": 0,
    "requiresPayment": false,
    "paymentLink": null,
    "introMessage": "Hello! I'm your AI legal assistant.",
    ...
  }
}
```

| Field             | Type    | Description                       |
| ----------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| `id`              | string  | Unique team ID                    |
| `name`            | string  | Display name                      |
| `consultationFee` | number  | Fee in USD                        |
| `requiresPayment` | boolean | Require payment before intake     |
| `paymentLink`     | string  | Link to payment page              |
| `introMessage`    | string  | Optional welcome message          |
| `profileImage`    | string  | Optional logo URL                 |
| `availableServices` | array  | List of practice areas            |
| `serviceQuestions` | object | Practice area-specific questions  |
| ...               |         | Other branding and service config |

To sync teams:

```bash
node sync-teams.js
```

* Full sync: removes entries not in the JSON
* Uses `id` to upsert records

---

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Follow-Up Questions

The chatbot now includes **practice area-specific follow-up questions** that are automatically triggered when a user selects a service. This creates a more intelligent and targeted intake process.

### How It Works

1. **Service Selection**: User clicks on a practice area (e.g., "Family Law")
2. **AI Questions**: System asks 3-5 targeted questions specific to that practice area
3. **Enhanced Intake**: Answers are collected and included in the final case summary
4. **Better Matching**: Attorneys receive more detailed case information

### Configuration

Add `serviceQuestions` to your team config:

```json
{
  "id": "family-law-firm",
  "config": {
    "availableServices": ["Family Law", "Divorce", "Custody"],
    "serviceQuestions": {
      "Family Law": [
        "What specific family law issue are you dealing with?",
        "Are there any children involved in this situation?",
        "Have you already filed any legal documents?",
        "What is your current living situation?"
      ],
      "Divorce": [
        "How long have you been married?",
        "Do you have any children together?",
        "Have you discussed divorce with your spouse?",
        "What are the main issues you need to resolve?"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Question Flow

1. **Service Selection** ‚Üí User picks practice area
2. **AI Questions** ‚Üí System asks targeted questions one by one
3. **Answer Collection** ‚Üí Each answer is stored with the question
4. **Summary** ‚Üí All answers are compiled into a comprehensive case summary
5. **Contact Form** ‚Üí Enhanced data is passed to the contact form

### Benefits

* **More Relevant**: Questions are tailored to specific practice areas
* **Better Data**: Attorneys receive detailed, structured information
* **Improved Matching**: Better attorney-client pairing based on case details
* **Professional**: Creates a more sophisticated intake experience

### Fallback

If no `serviceQuestions` are configured for a service, the system falls back to the generic case description flow.

## üìä Case Quality Scoring

The system now includes **AI-powered case quality scoring** that evaluates the completeness and readiness of each case for attorney review. This provides real-time feedback to users and helps attorneys prioritize cases.

### How It Works

1. **Real-time Scoring**: Quality score is calculated at each step of the case creation process
2. **Visual Feedback**: Users see a progress bar, breakdown, and suggestions for improvement
3. **Attorney Readiness**: Score indicates whether the case is ready for attorney review
4. **API-Driven**: All scoring logic is handled by the backend API

### Quality Score Components

The score (0-100%) is calculated based on:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Follow-up Completion** | 25% | Percentage of AI questions answered |
| **Required Fields** | 20% | Service, description, and answers provided |
| **Evidence** | 15% | Mentions of documents, photos, or evidence |
| **Clarity** | 15% | Specificity and detail in responses |
| **Urgency** | 10% | Urgency level specified |
| **Consistency** | 10% | Logical consistency of answers |
| **AI Confidence** | 5% | AI analysis confidence level |

### Score Levels

| Score Range | Badge | Color | Status |
|-------------|-------|-------|--------|
| 90-100% | Excellent | Blue | Ready for attorney |
| 75-89% | Good | Green | Ready for attorney |
| 50-74% | Fair | Yellow | Needs more info |
| 0-49% | Poor | Red | Needs significant improvement |

### API Endpoints

#### Case Quality Score

```bash
POST /api/case-quality
```

**Request:**
```json
{
  "teamId": "demo",
  "service": "contract-review",
  "description": "I need help reviewing a business contract...",
  "answers": {
    "What type of contract is this?": "Business service contract",
    "What is the value of the contract?": "Around $50,000"
  },
  "urgency": "Somewhat Urgent"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "score": 79,
  "breakdown": {
    "followUpCompletion": 100,
    "requiredFields": 100,
    "evidence": 0,
    "clarity": 66.67,
    "urgency": 100,
    "consistency": 100,
    "aiConfidence": 75
  },
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider uploading photos, documents, or other evidence related to your case.",
    "Provide more specific details about what happened and when."
  ],
  "readyForLawyer": true,
  "badge": "Good",
  "color": "green"
}
```

#### Case Creation with Quality Scores

The `/api/case-creation` endpoint now includes quality scores in all responses:

```json
{
  "step": "case-details",
  "message": "Thank you for sharing those details...",
  "qualityScore": {
    "score": 45,
    "breakdown": { ... },
    "suggestions": [ ... ],
    "readyForLawyer": false,
    "badge": "Poor",
    "color": "red"
  }
}
```

### Frontend Integration

The quality score is displayed in the chat interface as:

* **Progress Bar**: Visual representation of the score
* **Breakdown**: Individual component scores with mini progress bars
* **Suggestions**: Actionable tips to improve the score
* **Badge**: Color-coded status indicator
* **Ready Status**: Clear indication if case is ready for attorney

### Benefits

* **User Guidance**: Real-time feedback helps users provide better information
* **Attorney Efficiency**: Attorneys can quickly assess case readiness
* **Quality Control**: Ensures cases have sufficient information before attorney review
* **Professional Experience**: Creates a more sophisticated intake process
* **API-First**: Quality scoring can be integrated with external systems (Zapier, etc.)

### Integration Examples

#### Zapier Integration
```javascript
// Webhook to case quality endpoint
const qualityScore = await fetch('/api/case-quality', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(caseData)
});

// Use score for conditional logic
if (qualityScore.score >= 75) {
  // Automatically assign to attorney
} else {
  // Send follow-up questions
}
```

#### CRM Integration
```javascript
// Add quality score to CRM record
const crmRecord = {
  ...caseData,
  qualityScore: qualityScore.score,
  qualityBreakdown: qualityScore.breakdown,
  readyForAttorney: qualityScore.readyForLawyer
};
```

## Case Creation Flow

The system provides an intelligent case creation flow that guides potential clients through a structured process:

### Flow Steps (Improved Order)

1. **Service Selection** - Client selects their legal practice area
2. **Urgency Assessment** - Client indicates urgency level (Very Urgent, Somewhat Urgent, Not Urgent)
3. **AI-Powered Questions** - Practice area-specific questions to gather detailed information
4. **Case Description** - Client provides overall situation description
5. **AI Analysis** - Intelligent assessment of case readiness and information completeness
6. **Completion** - Case summary and connection to attorney

### Benefits of New Flow Order

- **Early Urgency Context**: Understanding urgency early helps prioritize information gathering
- **Better AI Guidance**: AI analysis happens after sufficient information is collected
- **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminates repetitive questions and improves user experience
- **Quality-Driven**: Each step contributes to case quality scoring
- **Flexible Paths**: Can skip AI questions if not needed, or loop back if more info required
