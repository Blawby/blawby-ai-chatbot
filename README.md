## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Best Practices

### Enhanced Security Headers
The application now includes comprehensive security headers following OWASP guidelines:

- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- **Referrer-Policy**: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: `camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()` - Restricts permissions
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` - Enforces HTTPS

### Request Validation
- **Size Limits**: 10MB maximum request size
- **Content Type Validation**: Ensures proper JSON for POST requests
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive validation with Zod schemas

### Error Handling & Monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted error logs with context
- **Error Categorization**: Proper HTTP status codes and error codes
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse
- **Security Monitoring**: Comprehensive audit trails

Enable remote bindings for local development:

```toml
# In wrangler.toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
experimental_remote = true

[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "CHAT_SESSIONS"
experimental_remote = true
```

## üß† Team Configuration

Configure your law firm teams via `teams.json`:

- The `sync-teams.js` script now performs a **true sync**:
  - All teams in `teams.json` are upserted (inserted or updated) into the D1 database.
  - Any team in the database not present in `teams.json` is deleted, along with all related records in dependent tables (cascading deletes).
  - This ensures your D1 database always matches your `teams.json` source of truth.

- **Remote vs Local DB:**
  - Use `node sync-teams.js --remote` to sync the remote D1 database (used by your deployed worker).
  - Use `node sync-teams.js` (no flag) to sync your local D1 database (used by local dev).
  - To verify which teams are present in D1, run:
    - `wrangler d1 execute blawby-ai-chatbot --remote --command "SELECT id, slug, name FROM teams;"` (remote)
    - `wrangler d1 execute blawby-ai-chatbot --local --command "SELECT id, slug, name FROM teams;"` (local)

- After syncing, both local and remote environments will have the correct teams and IDs for all lookups and webhooks.

- **Answer Length** (20%) - Adequacy of detail provided
- **Service Specificity** (15%) - Specificity of legal service area
- **Urgency Indication** (10%) - Presence of urgency indicators
- **Evidence Mentioned** (10%) - Documentation and evidence references
- **Timeline Provided** (10%) - Temporal context and dates
- **Answer Completeness** (10%) - Number of questions answered

#### Quality Scoring

```json
{
  "qualityScore": {
    "score": 76,
    "readyForLawyer": true,
    "breakdown": {
      "answerQuality": 100,
      "answerLength": 32,
      "serviceSpecificity": 100,
      "urgencyIndication": 0,
      "evidenceMentioned": 100,
      "timelineProvided": 100
    },
    "issues": [],

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Webhook Events

#### 1. Matter Creation (`matter_creation`)
Triggered when a client completes all required intake fields and the summary is shown.

```json
{
  "event": "matter_creation",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-17T23:47:26.000Z",
  "teamId": "your-law-firm",

    "phoneNumber": "555-0123",
    "matterDetails": "Need help with custody modification",
    "urgency": "normal",
    "status": "pending"
  }
}
```

Triggered when consultations are scheduled.

```json
{
  "event": "appointment",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-17T23:47:26.000Z",

    "preferredTime": "10:00 AM",
    "matterType": "Family Law",
    "notes": "Child custody consultation",
    "status": "pending"
  }
}
```

### Webhook Verification

To verify webhook authenticity in your endpoint (Stripe-like format):

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  // Parse signature header (format: "t=timestamp,v1=signature")
  const signatureParts = signature.split(',');
  const timestamp = signatureParts[0].split('=')[1];
  const receivedSignature = signatureParts[1].split('=')[1];
  
  // Create signed payload (timestamp.payload)
  const signedPayload = `${timestamp}.${payload}`;
  
  // Generate expected signature
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(signedPayload)
    .digest('hex');
  
  return receivedSignature === expectedSignature;
}

// Express.js example
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-webhook-signature'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  
  if (!verifyWebhook(payload, signature, 'your-webhook-secret')) {
    return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
  
  // Process webhook...
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```
