## ü§ñ Matter Creation Flow

The system provides an **intelligent matter building process** that guides users through structured data collection with AI-powered quality assessment:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Service Selection** ‚Üí User chooses practice area
2. **Practice Area Questions** ‚Üí Tailored questions for the selected service
3. **Matter Details** ‚Üí Comprehensive situation description
4. **AI Quality Assessment** ‚Üí Real-time content analysis and scoring
5. **Contact Collection** ‚Üí Seamless transition to attorney connection

### AI Quality Assessment

The system includes **comprehensive content analysis** that evaluates matter quality across multiple dimensions:

#### Quality Metrics

- **Answer Quality** (25%) - Meaningfulness and responsiveness of answers
- **Answer Length** (20%) - Adequacy of detail provided
- **Service Specificity** (15%) - Specificity of legal service area
- **Urgency Indication** (10%) - Presence of urgency indicators
- **Evidence Mentioned** (10%) - Documentation and evidence references
- **Timeline Provided** (10%) - Temporal context and dates
- **Answer Completeness** (10%) - Number of questions answered

#### Quality Scoring

```json
{
  "qualityScore": {
    "score": 76,
    "readyForLawyer": true,
    "breakdown": {
      "answerQuality": 100,
      "answerLength": 32,
      "serviceSpecificity": 100,
      "urgencyIndication": 0,
      "evidenceMentioned": 100,
      "timelineProvided": 100
    },
    "issues": [],
    "suggestions": [],
    "confidence": "medium"
  }
}
```

#### Quality Thresholds

- **Ready for Lawyer**: Score ‚â• 70 AND Answer Quality ‚â• 60%
- **Needs Improvement**: Score < 70 OR Answer Quality < 60%
- **High Confidence**: Score ‚â• 80 AND ‚â• 3 meaningful answers
- **Medium Confidence**: Score ‚â• 60 AND ‚â• 2 meaningful answers
- **Low Confidence**: Score < 60 OR < 2 meaningful answers

#### Smart Feedback

The system provides **intelligent follow-up messages** based on quality assessment:

- **Poor Quality**: "I noticed some of your answers were quite brief. To help you get the best legal assistance, could you provide more details?"
- **Good Quality**: "Great! Your matter summary looks comprehensive. You've provided strong information to connect you with the right attorney."
- **Excellent Quality**: "Excellent! Your matter summary is comprehensive and well-detailed. You've provided everything we need."

// Express.js example
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-webhook-signature'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  
  if (!verifyWebhook(payload, signature, 'your-webhook-secret')) {
