# Test 3: Mixed Legal/Non-Legal Conversation (should block non-legal parts)

echo "üîç Key Improvements Being Tested:"
echo "1. Context-aware filtering (established legal matters)"
echo "2. Legal whitelisting (technology law, research allowed)"
echo "3. Privacy-safe logging (no message content exposed)"
echo "4. Security filtering (jailbreak attempts blocked)"
echo "5. Multi-turn conversation handling"
echo "6. Middleware pipeline effectiveness"
echo ""
echo "üìä Expected Results:"
echo "- Legal conversations should work throughout"
echo "- Non-legal requests should be blocked mid-conversation"
echo "- Jailbreak attempts should be blocked immediately"
echo "- Context should be maintained across turns"
echo "- Privacy should be protected in all logs"
