## Technical Architecture

### Cloudflare Workers Configuration
```typescript
// wrangler.toml - Enhanced essentials-v3 project
name = "essentials-v3"
main = "src/worker/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

[ai]
binding = "AI"

[[ai.models]]
binding = "llama"
model = "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"

# Fresh resources for AI chatbot
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "CHAT_SESSIONS"
id = "your-new-kv-namespace-id"  # BLAWBY_AI_CHAT_SESSIONS

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "blawby-ai-chatbot"
database_id = "your-new-d1-database-id"  # blawby-ai-chatbot

# Domain already configured for ai.blawby.com
```

### Database Schema (D1)
```sql
-- Core tables
CREATE TABLE teams (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, config JSON);
CREATE TABLE conversations (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, team_id TEXT, session_id TEXT, user_info JSON, status TEXT);
CREATE TABLE messages (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, conversation_id TEXT, content TEXT, is_user BOOLEAN, metadata JSON);
CREATE TABLE services (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, team_id TEXT, name TEXT, requires_payment BOOLEAN, payment_amount INTEGER, intake_form JSON);
CREATE TABLE appointments (id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, conversation_id TEXT, scheduled_date DATETIME, status TEXT, payment_status TEXT);
```

### API Endpoints
- **Core Chat**: `POST /api/chat`, `GET /api/chat/:sessionId`, `POST /api/chat/stream`
- **Team Config**: `GET /api/teams/:teamId`, `PUT /api/teams/:teamId/config`
- **Services**: `GET /api/services`, `GET /api/services/:id/intake-form`
- **Files**: `POST /api/upload`, `GET /api/files/:fileId`
- **Scheduling**: `POST /api/schedule`, `GET /api/schedule/:appointmentId`
- **Payment**: `POST /api/payment/webhook`, `GET /api/payment/:paymentId/status`
- **Legacy**: Maintain `/api/chatbot` for backward compatibility

    stream: true
  });
  return response;
};
```

### Real-time Communication
```typescript
// Server-Sent Events for streaming
const streamChatResponse = async (message: string) => {
  const eventSource = new EventSource(`/api/chat/stream?sessionId=${sessionId}`);
  
  eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    if (data.type === 'chunk') {
      updateStreamingMessage(data.content);
    } else if (data.type === 'complete') {
      eventSource.close();
    }
  };
};
```
