# Linting Improvement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to improve code quality by enforcing stricter linting rules and incrementally addressing existing warnings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Stricter Linting Rules
- **Updated `lint:check` script**: Changed from `--max-warnings 250` to `--max-warnings 0`
- **Purpose**: Ensures CI fails on any warnings, enforcing higher code quality standards
- **Impact**: CI will now fail if there are any ESLint warnings

### 2. Auto-fix Capability
- **Existing `lint:fix` script**: Already available with `eslint . --fix`
- **Usage**: Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix fixable ESLint issues
- **Recommendation**: Use this before manual fixes to reduce workload

## Incremental Warning Resolution Plan

### Sprint-based Approach
**Goal**: Fix 20 warnings per sprint to gradually improve code quality without overwhelming the organization.

### Phase 1: Assessment (Sprint 1)
1. **Run current linting**: `npm run lint:check` to identify all warnings
2. **Categorize warnings**:
   - Auto-fixable (use `npm run lint:fix`)
   - Manual fixes required
   - Complex refactoring needed
3. **Prioritize by impact**:
   - High: Security, performance, maintainability issues
   - Medium: Code style, best practices
   - Low: Minor style preferences

### Phase 2: Systematic Resolution (Sprints 2-6)
**Target**: 20 warnings per sprint

#### Sprint 2: Auto-fixable Issues
- Run `npm run lint:fix` to resolve automatically fixable warnings
- Review and commit changes
- Document any unexpected behavior changes

#### Sprint 3-4: Manual Fixes (High Priority)
- Focus on security and performance warnings
- Address TypeScript strict mode issues
- Fix accessibility warnings

#### Sprint 5-6: Manual Fixes (Medium Priority)
- Code style and consistency issues
- Unused variables and imports
- Missing prop types or interfaces

### Phase 3: Complex Issues (Sprints 7+)
- Large refactoring tasks
- Architecture improvements
- Breaking changes requiring careful planning

## ESLint Disable Guidelines

### When to Use `// eslint-disable-next-line`
**Only use when**:
1. **Legitimate technical reasons**:
   - Third-party library limitations
   - Performance-critical code with measured impact
   - Framework-specific patterns that ESLint doesn't understand

2. **Temporary workarounds**:
   - During major refactoring
   - When waiting for library updates
   - During migration phases

### Approval Process
**Required for all `eslint-disable` usage**:
1. **Justification**: Clear explanation of why the disable is necessary
2. **Reviewer approval**: At least one senior developer must approve
3. **Documentation**: Add comment explaining the technical reason
4. **Expiration**: Set a date for re-evaluation (e.g., 3-6 months)

### Example Format
```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
// Reason: Third-party library returns untyped data, will be addressed in v2.1.0
// Approved by: [Reviewer Name] on [Date]
// Re-evaluate: [Date]
const data: any = thirdPartyLibrary.getData();
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Actions
- [x] Update `lint:check` script to `--max-warnings 0`
- [x] Verify `lint:fix` script exists and works
- [ ] Run initial assessment of current warnings
- [ ] Create GitHub issue for tracking progress

### Sprint 1 Tasks
- [ ] Run `npm run lint:check` and document all warnings
- [ ] Run `npm run lint:fix` and commit auto-fixable changes
- [ ] Categorize remaining warnings by priority
- [ ] Create backlog items for manual fixes

### Ongoing Process
- [ ] Include linting fixes in sprint planning
- [ ] Review and approve any `eslint-disable` requests
- [ ] Monitor warning count trends
- [ ] Update this plan based on progress

## Success Metrics
- **Short-term**: Reduce warning count by 20 per sprint
- **Medium-term**: Achieve 0 warnings in CI
- **Long-term**: Maintain 0 warnings with strict rules

## organization Guidelines
1. **Pre-commit**: Run `npm run lint:fix` before committing
2. **Code reviews**: Check for new warnings in PRs
3. **CI/CD**: Ensure `lint:check` passes in all environments
4. **Documentation**: Update this plan as we learn and adapt
