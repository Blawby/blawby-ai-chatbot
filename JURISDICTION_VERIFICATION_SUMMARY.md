## **Overview**

Added a comprehensive jurisdiction verification system to ensure users are in supported areas before proceeding with legal assistance. This feature helps maintain compliance and provides clear guidance to users about service availability.

## **🎯 Features Implemented**

### **1. Team Configuration Updates**
- **Added jurisdiction configuration** to `teams.json`
- **Blawby AI**: National service (all US states)
- **North Carolina Legal Services**: State-specific (NC only)

### **2. AI Agent Integration**
- **New `verify_jurisdiction` tool** added to legal intake agent
- **Automatic location detection** from user messages
- **Smart jurisdiction validation** based on team configuration

### **3. Frontend Updates**
- **Updated `teamConfig` type** to include jurisdiction information
- **Enhanced team config fetching** to include jurisdiction data
- **Seamless integration** with existing chat flow

## **📋 Configuration Examples**

### **National Service (Blawby AI)**
```json

  "jurisdiction": {
    "type": "national",
    "description": "Available nationwide",
    "supportedStates": ["all"],

}
```

### **State-Specific Service (North Carolina Legal Services)**
```json
{
  "jurisdiction": {

    "primaryState": "NC"
