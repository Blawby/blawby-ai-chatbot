# Paralegal Agent Flow Redesign Plan

## 🎯 Current State Analysis

### What We've Built So Far

#### ✅ Infrastructure Complete
- **Durable Object**: `ParalegalAgent` with state machine (`collect_parties` → `conflicts_check` → `documents_needed` → `fee_scope` → `engagement` → `filing_prep` → `completed`)
- **Supervisor Router**: Intent-based routing with feature flags
- **Database Schema**: Tables for matter formation stages, conflict checks, document requirements, engagement letters, audit logs
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/paralegal/:teamId/:matterId/{advance|status|checklist}`
- **Service Stubs**: ConflictCheck, DocumentRequirement, EngagementLetter, RiskAssessment services
- **Queue Integration**: `PARALEGAL_TASKS` queue for background processing

#### ✅ Current Routing Logic
```
SupervisorRouter:
├── Feature Flag Check: enableParalegalAgent
├── Intent Detection:
│   ├── Post-Payment Queries → Paralegal Agent
│   ├── Matter Formation Keywords → Paralegal Agent  
│   ├── Document Analysis → Analysis Agent
│   └── Default → Intake Agent
```

#### ✅ Working Handoff
- **Intake Agent**: Collects basic info (name, contact, opposing party)
- **Completion Signal**: "Perfect! I have all the information... matter has been created..."
- **Natural Handoff**: User says "what happens now?" → Routes to Paralegal Agent
- **Graceful Transition**: Paralegal Agent provides comprehensive matter formation guidance

### Current Flow Issues Identified

#### 🚨 Problem 1: Backwards Priority
- **Current**: Intake Agent is default → Paralegal Agent is secondary
- **Issue**: Users get basic intake first, then advanced paralegal help
- **Better**: Paralegal Agent should be primary → Intake Agent for specific needs

#### 🚨 Problem 2: Redundant Information Collection
- **Current**: Intake Agent collects basic info → Paralegal Agent asks for detailed info
- **Issue**: Users provide information twice
- **Better**: Paralegal Agent should collect all information comprehensively

#### 🚨 Problem 3: Unclear Value Proposition
- **Current**: "A lawyer will contact you" → then Paralegal Agent asks more questions
- **Issue**: Confusing user experience about what happens next
- **Better**: Clear progression from AI assistance → human review when needed

## 🎯 Proposed New Flow Design

### Primary Flow: Paralegal Agent First

```
User Query → SupervisorRouter → Route Decision:

┌─ PARALEGAL AGENT (Primary) ────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Default for: Legal questions, case help, document needs       │
│  Handles: Comprehensive case building, document analysis,      │
│           legal guidance, matter formation                     │
│  Offers: Human review when AI reaches limits                  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
           │
           ├─ User wants human contact → Transfer to Intake Agent
           ├─ Complex analysis needed → Analysis Agent  
           └─ Case complete → Offer lawyer consultation

┌─ INTAKE AGENT (Secondary) ─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Triggered by: "speak to lawyer", "schedule consultation",     │
│                "need human help", explicit requests           │
│  Handles: Contact collection, scheduling, payment processing   │
│  Purpose: Bridge to human lawyers                             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ ANALYSIS AGENT (Specialized) ─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Triggered by: Document uploads, complex legal analysis       │
│  Handles: Heavy document processing, legal research           │
│  Purpose: Specialized AI analysis tasks                       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### New Supervisor Router Logic

```typescript
async route(body: any, teamConfig: any): Promise<'paralegal' | 'intake' | 'analysis'> {
  // 1. Check for explicit human/lawyer requests
  if (this.wantsHumanLawyer(text)) {
    return 'intake';
  }
  
  // 2. Check for document analysis needs
  if (this.needsDocumentAnalysis(text, attachments)) {
    return 'analysis';
  }
  
  // 3. Default to Paralegal Agent for all legal questions
  if (paralegalEnabled) {
    return 'paralegal';
  }
  
  // 4. Fallback to intake only if Paralegal Agent disabled
  return 'intake';
}
```

### Enhanced Paralegal Agent Capabilities

#### Stage 1: Initial Legal Assessment
- **Welcome**: "I'm your AI paralegal. I can help you understand your legal situation and build your case."
- **Gather Context**: What's your legal issue? What's happened so far?
- **Assess Complexity**: Can I help directly, or do you need a human lawyer?

#### Stage 2: Comprehensive Case Building
- **Detailed Information**: All relevant facts, dates, documents
- **Legal Analysis**: AI-powered guidance on options and next steps
- **Document Collection**: What evidence/paperwork do you need?

#### Stage 3: Smart Handoff Decision
```
AI Assessment Complete:
├── Simple Case → "I can help you handle this. Here's what to do..."
├── Medium Complexity → "I can guide you through most of this. Let's start..."
└── Complex Case → "This needs human expertise. Let me collect your info for a lawyer consultation."
```

### Intake Agent's New Role

#### Trigger Conditions
- User explicitly asks: "I want to talk to a lawyer"
- User requests: "Schedule a consultation" 
- Paralegal Agent determines: "This needs human review"
- Payment/scheduling needs

#### Focused Purpose
- **Contact Collection**: Only when human lawyer needed
- **Scheduling**: Consultation appointments
- **Payment Processing**: For lawyer consultations
- **Handoff Preparation**: Brief lawyer on case details from Paralegal Agent

---

## 🔧 Implementation Changes Needed

### 1. Supervisor Router Updates
```typescript
// Current logic (backwards):
if (postPaymentQuery || matterFormationKeywords) return 'paralegal';
else return 'intake';

// New logic (Paralegal first):
if (wantsHumanLawyer || scheduling) return 'intake';
else if (documentAnalysis) return 'analysis'; 
else return 'paralegal'; // Default
```

### 2. Paralegal Agent Enhancements
- **Welcome Message**: Position as primary legal assistant
- **Capability Assessment**: Determine if case needs human lawyer
- **Information Collection**: Comprehensive, not redundant with intake
- **Smart Routing**: Transfer to intake only when human needed

### 3. Intake Agent Refinements  
- **Positioning**: "Let me collect your contact info for a lawyer consultation"
- **Context Awareness**: Receive case summary from Paralegal Agent
- **Focused Collection**: Only contact/scheduling info, not case details
- **Handoff**: Brief lawyer with Paralegal Agent's case analysis

### 4. User Experience Flow
```
User: "I'm getting divorced"
↓
Paralegal Agent: "I can help you understand divorce process and prepare your case. 
                 Tell me about your situation..."
↓
[Comprehensive case building with AI guidance]
↓
Paralegal Agent Decision:
├── "I can guide you through this process step-by-step"
└── "This situation needs human expertise. Let me connect you with a lawyer."
    ↓
    Transfer to Intake Agent: "Let me collect your contact info for consultation"
```

## ❓ Questions for Review

1. **Routing Logic**: Does the new "Paralegal first, Intake when needed" approach make sense?

2. **Capability Boundaries**: How should Paralegal Agent decide when to transfer to human lawyer?

3. **Information Handoff**: Should Paralegal Agent pass case details to Intake Agent for lawyer briefing?

4. **Feature Flag Strategy**: Should we:
   - Keep current flag system for gradual rollout?
   - Add new flag for "Paralegal-first mode"?
   - Make this the new default behavior?

5. **Backward Compatibility**: How do we handle teams that want the old Intake-first flow?

6. **User Messaging**: How should we position the Paralegal Agent to users? ("AI Paralegal", "Legal Assistant", "Case Builder"?)

- What adjustments would you like to see?
- Should we proceed with implementation?
- Any specific concerns about the user experience?

I'm ready to implement these changes once you approve the approach!
