# Security Implementation Summary

## âœ… Successfully Implemented Security Features

### **Phase 1: Comprehensive Security Enforcement (COMPLETED)**

#### 1.1 SecurityFilter Class (`worker/utils/securityFilter.ts`)
- **Multi-layer validation**: 4-tier security validation system
- **Jailbreak detection**: Prevents role changes and instruction bypassing
- **Non-legal request filtering**: Blocks technical, entertainment, creative, and general knowledge requests
- **Service scope validation**: Team-specific service offering validation
- **Jurisdiction validation**: Geographic location and state/country matching
- **Pattern matching**: Comprehensive regex patterns for all violation types

#### 1.2 Input Validation Middleware (`worker/middleware/inputValidation.ts`)
- **Request validation**: Validates all incoming requests before AI processing
- **Team-specific responses**: Customized security responses based on team configuration
- **Violation logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security violations

#### 1.3 Security Logging (`worker/utils/securityLogger.ts`)
- **Event logging**: Logs all security events with detailed metadata
- **Violation tracking**: Tracks different types of security violations
- **Team-specific logging**: Associates violations with specific teams

#### 1.4 Enhanced Agent Route (`worker/routes/agent.ts`)
- **Pre-processing validation**: Validates requests before AI model interaction
- **Security responses**: Returns appropriate security messages for violations
- **Team configuration integration**: Uses team config for dynamic validation

#### 1.5 Hardened System Prompt (`worker/agents/legalIntakeAgent.ts`)
- **Explicit security rules**: Clear prohibitions against role changes and non-legal activities
- **Role reinforcement**: Multiple reminders about the AI's legal intake specialist role
- **Security boundaries**: Explicit rules against technical, entertainment, and creative requests

## ðŸ”’ Security Features Implemented

### **1. Jailbreak Prevention**
- Detects attempts to change AI role or bypass instructions
- Patterns: `ignore instructions`, `act as`, `system prompt`, `bypass restrictions`
- **Priority**: Highest priority - checked before all other validations

### **2. Non-Legal Request Filtering**
- **Technical requests**: Programming, coding, terminal emulation
- **Entertainment requests**: Games, role-playing, creative activities
- **General knowledge**: Research, document writing, educational content
- **Creative tasks**: Poetry, art, story writing

### **3. Service Scope Validation**
- **Dynamic validation**: Based on `teamConfig.availableServices`
- **Legal matter detection**: Extracts legal matter types from user input
- **Team-specific blocking**: Only blocks services not offered by the specific team

### **4. Jurisdiction Validation**
- **Location extraction**: Extracts location from user input
- **State mapping**: Maps state codes to full names (NC â†’ North Carolina)
- **Geographic filtering**: Validates against team's supported jurisdictions

## ðŸ§ª Comprehensive Testing

### **Test Coverage: 18/18 Tests Passing**
- âœ… **Technical requests**: Terminal emulation, programming help
- âœ… **Entertainment requests**: Games, role-playing
- âœ… **Jailbreak attempts**: Role changes, instruction bypassing
- âœ… **Service scope**: Team-specific service validation
- âœ… **Jurisdiction**: Geographic location validation
- âœ… **Valid requests**: Legal assistance requests

### **Test Scenarios**
1. **Blawby AI Team**: Business law (allowed), Family law (blocked)
2. **NC Legal Team**: Family law (allowed), IP law (blocked)
3. **Jurisdiction**: NC locations (allowed), CA locations (blocked)
4. **Security**: Jailbreak attempts, technical requests, entertainment
