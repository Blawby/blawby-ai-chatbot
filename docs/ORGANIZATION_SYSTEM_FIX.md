# Organization System Fix - Better Auth Integration

## Problem Summary

The organization system had several issues:

1. **Personal organization not being identified**: The `useOrganizationConfig` hook was not correctly identifying personal organizations because the `isPersonal` flag was being stripped by Zod schema validation.

2. **Better Auth integration issues**: The `get-full-organization` endpoint was returning 500 errors due to missing `invitations` model in the Drizzle schema.

3. **Inefficient organization fetching**: The system was fetching all organizations instead of just the active/personal organization.

4. **Infinite API call loops**: Multiple `useEffect` hooks were causing infinite loops of API calls.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Zod Schema Missing `isPersonal` Field

The `OrganizationSchema` in `src/hooks/useOrganizationConfig.ts` was missing the `isPersonal` field:

```typescript
// BEFORE (missing isPersonal)
const OrganizationSchema = z.object({
  slug: z.string().optional(),
  id: z.string().optional(),
  name: z.string().optional(),
  config: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional()
});

// AFTER (includes isPersonal)
const OrganizationSchema = z.object({
  slug: z.string().optional(),
  id: z.string().optional(),
  name: z.string().optional(),
  config: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional(),
  isPersonal: z.boolean().optional()
});
```

**Impact**: The `isPersonal` field was being stripped during Zod validation, causing the personal organization detection to fail.

### Issue 2: Better Auth Drizzle Schema Missing `invitations` Table

The Better Auth organization plugin requires the `invitations` table to be defined in the Drizzle schema, but it was missing from `worker/db/auth.schema.ts`.

**Impact**: The `get-full-organization` endpoint was returning 500 errors with the message:
```
BetterAuthError: [# Drizzle Adapter]: The model "invitations" was not found in the schema object.
```

### Issue 3: Infinite Loop in useEffect Dependencies

Multiple `useEffect` hooks had unstable dependencies causing infinite re-renders and API calls.

**Impact**: The system was making hundreds of API calls, causing performance issues and backend crashes.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Zod Schema

Added the `isPersonal` field to the `OrganizationSchema` to preserve the personal organization flag during validation.

### 2. Added Missing `invitations` Table

Added the `invitations` table to the Drizzle schema in `worker/db/auth.schema.ts`:

```typescript
export const invitations = sqliteTable("invitations", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  organizationId: text("organization_id")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => organizations.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  email: text("email").notNull(),
  role: text("role").notNull(),
  status: text("status").default("pending"),
  invitedBy: text("invited_by")
    .notNull()
    .references(() => users.id, { onDelete: "cascade" }),
  expiresAt: integer("expires_at", { mode: "timestamp" }).notNull(),
  createdAt: integer("created_at", { mode: "timestamp" }).notNull(),
}, (table) => ({
  invitationEmailIdx: index("invitation_email_idx").on(table.email),
  invitationOrgIdx: index("invitation_org_idx").on(table.organizationId),
}));
```

### 3. Stabilized useEffect Dependencies

Fixed infinite loops by:

- Removing `refetch` from its own dependency array in `useOrganizationManagement.ts`
- Changing dependencies from `[session, sessionLoading, refetch]` to `[session?.user?.id, sessionLoading]`
- Adding `refetchTriggeredRef` to ensure `refetch()` is called only once per session change
- Modifying `OrganizationPage.tsx` to only depend on `currentOrganization?.id`

### 4. Improved Personal Organization Detection

Updated the personal organization detection logic to check the root-level `isPersonal` field instead of looking in the `config` object:

```typescript
// BEFORE (incorrect)
const personalOrg = organizationsResponse.data.find(org => {
  return org.config?.isPersonal === true;
});

// AFTER (correct)
const personalOrg = organizationsResponse.data.find(org => {
  return org.isPersonal === true;
});
```

## Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ `get-full-organization` returning 500 errors
- ❌ Personal organization not being identified
- ❌ Infinite API call loops
- ❌ Hundreds of unnecessary API requests
- ❌ Backend crashes due to excessive load

### After Fix
- ✅ `get-full-organization` returning 200 OK
- ✅ Personal organization correctly identified and displayed
- ✅ No infinite loops
- ✅ Efficient API usage (only 4 calls to `/api/organizations/me`)
- ✅ Stable backend performance

## Network Request Analysis

### Before Fix
```
GET /api/organizations/me (called 100+ times)
GET /api/organizations/mhbb1m7vqybu1rc2xmg/member (called 50+ times)
GET /api/organizations/mhbb1m7vqybu1rc2xmg/tokens (called 50+ times)
GET /api/auth/organization/get-full-organization (500 errors)
```

### After Fix
```
GET /api/auth/get-session (200 OK)
GET /api/auth/organization/get-full-organization (200 OK)
GET /api/organizations/me (200 OK, called 4 times)
GET /api/usage/quota?organizationId=mhbbd0o6h066fniihbo (200 OK)
GET /api/activity?organizationId=mhbbd0o6h066fniihbo&limit=25 (200 OK)
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Zod Schema Completeness**: Always ensure Zod schemas include all fields that need to be preserved from API responses.

2. **Better Auth Plugin Requirements**: Better Auth plugins may require additional database tables that must be defined in the Drizzle schema.

3. **useEffect Dependency Management**: Carefully manage `useEffect` dependencies to prevent infinite loops, especially when dealing with functions and objects that change reference.

4. **Debug Logging**: Systematic debug logging was crucial for identifying the root cause of the `isPersonal` field being undefined.

## Files Modified

1. `src/hooks/useOrganizationConfig.ts` - Fixed Zod schema and personal organization detection
2. `worker/db/auth.schema.ts` - Added missing `invitations` table
3. `src/hooks/useOrganizationManagement.ts` - Stabilized useEffect dependencies
4. `src/components/settings/pages/OrganizationPage.tsx` - Fixed useEffect dependencies

## Testing

The fix was validated using Playwright browser testing to:
- Confirm personal organization is correctly identified
- Verify API calls are efficient and not infinite
- Ensure Better Auth endpoints return 200 OK
- Validate the UI displays the correct organization information

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The organization system is now working correctly with:
- Proper personal organization detection
- Efficient API usage
- Stable Better Auth integration
- No infinite loops or crashes
