# Organization Display Bug Fix

## Problem Description

The organization settings page was showing "No Organization Yet" even when the user had a personal organization in the database and the API was returning the correct data.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug
The issue was a **race condition** in the `useOrganizationManagement` hook caused by the abort controller logic.

### Technical Details

1. **API Response**: The `/api/organizations/me` endpoint was correctly returning organization data:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "id": "mhafpxhhmdipxa5mz5f",
       "name": "Test User's Organization",
       "isPersonal": true,
       // ... other fields
     }
   ]
   ```

2. **Race Condition**: The `useEffect` hook was being triggered multiple times:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (!sessionLoading && session?.user?.id) {
       refetch();
     }
   }, [session?.user?.id, sessionLoading]);
   ```

3. **Abort Controller Issue**: Each call to `fetchOrganizations` would:
   - Create a new `AbortController`
   - Start the API call
   - Get aborted by the next call before completing
   - Return early due to `controller.signal.aborted` check

4. **State Never Set**: Because the requests were being aborted, the organization data was never processed and `setCurrentOrganization` was never called.

### Debug Evidence

The debug logs showed:
```
üîç DEBUG: fetchOrganizations starting for user: testuser123@example.com
üîç DEBUG: Raw API response type: object isArray: true length: 1
üîç DEBUG: Request was aborted, returning
```

The API was returning data, but the abort controller was preventing it from being processed.

## Solution

### The Fix
Removed the abort controller check that was preventing organization data processing:

```typescript
// REMOVED THIS BLOCK:
// Check if request was aborted after ensure personal org
if (controller.signal.aborted) {
  return;
}
```

### Why This Works
- The abort controller was causing premature returns
- Without the abort check, the organization data gets processed normally
- The state gets set correctly: `setCurrentOrganization(personalOrg || orgList[0] || null)`
- The UI displays the organization properly

## Files Modified

- `src/hooks/useOrganizationManagement.ts` - Removed abort controller check
- `src/components/settings/pages/OrganizationPage.tsx` - Added debug logging

## Testing

The fix was verified using Playwright browser automation:
1. Created a new test user
2. Confirmed personal organization was created in database
3. Verified API returns correct data
4. Confirmed UI now displays organization details instead of "No Organization Yet"

## Result

‚úÖ **Before**: "No Organization Yet" displayed despite having organization data
‚úÖ **After**: Organization details properly displayed:
- Organization Name: "Test User's Organization"
- Subscription Plan: "Free" 
- Organization Slug: "bsvenzkjs4d3pg0m-afpxhg"
- Team Members: "No team members yet"
- Pending Invitations: "No pending invitations"

## Debug Logs

Debug logs were added to track the issue and are currently kept for future debugging:
- API response logging
- State management logging
- Condition evaluation logging
- Race condition detection logging
