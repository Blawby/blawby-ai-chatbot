Check for lint/ts errors and resolve before commit request (only when writing code, not documentation)
Don’t use useEffect for React-internal logic (derived state, data transforms, “when X changes set Y”, or user events). Use it only for external synchronization (DOM/Browser APIs, subscriptions, timers, fetch with cleanup).
